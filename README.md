#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. #This project wanted you to read in a file and give the user options on how to analyze the file for item frequencies. From the beginning, a backup file was created with the list of items and their frequencies on the list.

#What did you do particularly well? #I think I was able to use my knowledge to create a clean, working code that made it easy for the user to use.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? #I could enhance my code by learning how to make it less redundant in certain areas, I am sure that I had code that could have been used in other areas, or less in certain areas. By making the code less redundant, it would save memory and have a quicker run time.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? #Deciding what to put in certain classes still is a bit tricky for me. Especially when using a header file with public and private sections. I would use the textbook for examples or google which would lead me to forums like stack overflow for real life examples as well. I think this is something that with time will get easier because I will have more experience.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? #Everything that I learned with this project will be skills that I can use in other areas of my coursework. I learned how to use header files to clean up the program, we learned the use of public and private variables and functions, and so much more. Using loops to access different items in a list or to print specific items will be used for sure.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? #I tried to make the main file as small as possible. I only included the functions from the header file because they were created in the .cpp file that went with it. I know that the main needed to be as clean as possible and I feel that I was able to do that. The classes and functions were created in the other files so they are easy to access and change as needed.
